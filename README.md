## Profissional Information:

- My name is Miguel Cruz, I'm 23 years old. I was born in Recife - PE, Brazil.  :beach_umbrella:

- I'm finishing my Computer Engineering bachelor at Cin - UFPE and planning to start my Master degree in 2022. 
I'm currently researcher at Motorola (Lenovo). 

- I've worked in projects involving Embedded Systems, Hardware and Software Engineering (Fuzzing).
- I'm currently working with projects involving Deep Learning, Signals and Pattern Recognition. More specifically applied to Image, Computational Photography and  Audio. I also study Logic, Philosophy, Theory of Computation, Algorithms, Calculus and Analysis by myself. 
I love to learn new things from the basis and try to relationate with my previous knowledge. I'm always trying to see and think from a different (and sometimes bizarre) way. I'm always very excited to colaborate in different projects, researches and study groups. So the logic conclusion is that I was born to study and to be a scientist.  :zany_face: :zany_face: :zany_face:
- I speak Portuguese, English and French.
