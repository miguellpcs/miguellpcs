## Profissional Information:

- My name is Miguel Cruz, I'm 24 years old. I was born in Recife - PE, Brazil.  :beach_umbrella:

- I have a bachelor in Computer Engineering at Cin - UFPE and studying on Master degree in Computational Photography/Deep Learning. 
I'm currently researcher at Motorola (Lenovo) and Working as a Software Engineer focused in Mathematical Optimization at FCxLabs. 

- I've worked in projects involving Embedded Systems, Hardware and Software Engineering (Fuzzing).
- I'm currently working with projects involving Deep Learning, Signals and Pattern Recognition. More specifically applied to Image, Computational Photography and  Audio. I also study Logic, Philosophy, Theory of Computation, Algorithms, Abstract/Linear/Vetorial Algebra, Calculus and Real/Complex Analysis by myself. 
I love to learn new things from the basis and try to relationate with my previous knowledge. I'm always trying to see and think from a different (and sometimes bizarre) way. I'm always very excited to collaborate with different projects, researches and study groups. So the logic conclusion is that I was born to study and to be a scientist.  :zany_face: :zany_face: :zany_face:
